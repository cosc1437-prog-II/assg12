**Description**

For this task, first declare an enumerated type named `Face` as described to represent
the face values in a standard deck of cards. 

Then implement a function named `faceToString()`.  This function takes
a `Face` data type as input and returns a `string` representation
of the face value.

**Suggested Solution**


**Additional Requirements**

- You are required to order the face values in the indicated enumeration
  order (your tests will not work later on if not declared in the
  correct order).
- You are required to declare the `Face` enumeration in the
  assignment library header file.  This is where most user data
  types should be declared, in a header file that will be included
  in other files.
- You are required to use a `switch` statement in your implementation
  and have a `default` case that detects and does something if an
  unknown `Face` is created and passed to the function.
